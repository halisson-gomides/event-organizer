# Current Work Context

## Current Focus
Session storage configuration and authentication system.

## Recent Changes
- Fixed session storage configuration in app.py and database.py
  - Resolved naming conflict between `session_config` variables (database sessions vs HTTP sessions)
  - Renamed database session config to `db_session_config` in database.py
  - Properly configured `SQLAlchemyAsyncSessionBackend` to store user sessions in `user_sessions` table
  - Created session middleware with `DefineMiddleware` and `SessionMiddleware` directly
  - Verified sessions are now being stored correctly in the database
- Previous work:
  - Added check-in and check-out menu items to base.html navigation
  - Implemented authorization helper functions in middleware.py
  - Added role-based restrictions to controllers

## Next Steps
- Test the authorization implementation with different user profiles
- Consider adding visual indicators in the UI for restricted actions
- Add comprehensive testing suite
- Improve error handling in controllers

## Project State
The project is in a functional state with:
- Complete backend implementation (Python/Litestar)
- Database schema with migrations
- Authentication system with session management
- Role-based authorization system with three profiles:
  - Administrador: Full access
  - Organizador: Can manage events, participants, and perform check-in/check-out
  - Volunt√°rio: Can only perform check-in/check-out
- CRUD operations for events and participants (restricted to admin/organizer)
- Check-in/check-out functionality with safety codes (accessible to all profiles)
- Responsive HTMX frontend with navigation menu
- Sample data initialization

## Known Issues/Areas for Improvement
- No comprehensive testing suite
- Limited error handling in some controllers
- No API documentation
- Missing deployment configuration
- UI could show/hide buttons based on user permissions
