# Product Description

## Why This Project Exists

This project addresses the critical need for safe and efficient management of presential events, particularly those involving children. Traditional event management systems lack the safety features required for child-focused activities, where attendance tracking and guardian verification are essential for compliance and security.

## Problems It Solves

1. **Child Safety in Events**: Provides secure check-in/check-out system with safety codes for minors, ensuring only authorized guardians can pick up children.

2. **Guardian Relationship Management**: Maintains proper guardian-child relationships, allowing adults to be responsible for multiple children while preventing unauthorized access.

3. **Event Organization Complexity**: Handles both single events and complex recurring event schedules with multiple time slots.

4. **Attendance Tracking**: Real-time attendance monitoring with detailed records of check-in/check-out times and responsible parties.

5. **User Access Control**: Role-based authentication system ensuring appropriate access levels for different user types (admin, organizer, volunteer).

## How It Should Work

### Core User Journey

1. **Event Creation**: Organizers create events (single or recurring) with detailed scheduling information.

2. **Participant Registration**: Parents/guardians register themselves and their children, establishing legal relationships.

3. **Event Attendance**: 
   - Children receive unique safety codes upon check-in
   - Only authorized guardians can check-out children using the code
   - Real-time attendance tracking for all participants

4. **Management Dashboard**: Administrators and organizers can view attendance reports, manage users, and oversee event operations.
